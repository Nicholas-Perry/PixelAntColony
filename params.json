I plan on growing this project out to a much grander design once I meet their requirements. Our hope is to create something to share our interest in ants and inspire others to learn more about them.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n - Must run on the desktop.\r\n - Must be accessible to be modified by others in the future.\r\n - Written in JavaScript, targeting html5 canvas.  \r\n - No server-sides component (at the current time).\r\n\r\n## Design \r\nThe design document is located in a [OneNote Notebook, accessible via microsoft OneDrive][1].\r\n\r\n## Influences\r\nMany of the prototypes leading up to this were simple simulations done using windows.h and low level console primitives. It is heavily influenced by Dwarf Fortress, SimAnt, Banished, and Conway's Game of Life.\r\n\r\n## How to install\r\nJust copy the .html file to your computer and open it with any [modern browser][2].\r\n\r\n## Contact / Collaborate\r\nWhile this is primarily a solo project, I am open to taking pull requests. Feel free to contact me on reddit /u/ultimape or via [Google+][3].\r\n\r\nIf you would like to learn more about my background, My 'cv' is available online: https://careers.stackoverflow.com/nicholasperry\r\n\r\n> Written with [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://skydrive.live.com/redir?page=view&resid=13B6E055D5BD0E7A!2473&authkey=!AP8P3kjBRdoM5io\r\n  [2]: www.google.com/chrome/\r\n  [3]: https://plus.google.com/+NicholasPerry-Ape/posts/1tzy7tdHuj4","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
