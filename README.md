# Pixel Ant Colony

## About
Pixel Ant Colony is an open source ant simulation game.

It is inspired by my obsession with ants. I am attempting to implement a physically based simulation of scent trails and a realistic behavior model (within the limitations of a 2d enviroment.

This was originally contracted as a small project by a 3rd party as a benefactor. I plan on growing this project out to a much grander design once I meet the requirements. Our hope is to create something to share our interest in ants and inspire others to learn more about them.

## Features

 - Must run on the desktop.
 - Must be accessible to be modified by others in the future.
 - Written in JavaScript, targeting html5 canvas.  
 - No server-sides component (at the current time).

## Design 
The design document is located in a [OneNote Notebook, accessible via microsoft OneDrive][1].

## Influences
many of the prototypes leading up to this were simple simulations done using windows.h and low level console primitives. It is heavily influenced by Dwarf Fortress, SimAnt, and Banished.

## How to install
Just copy the .html file to your computer and open it with any [modern browser][2].

## Contact / Collaborate
While this is primarily a solo project, I am open to taking pull requests. Feel free to contact me on reddit /u/ultimape or via [Google+][3].
